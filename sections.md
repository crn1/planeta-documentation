# Theme Sections

As mentioned before, Planeta comes with various section types that
can be displayed on the frontpage. You can edit them in the admin dashboard, in
the **Planeta** section.

## Generic Sections
Generic Sections act like any other section, as they can be displayed on the
frontpage and their appearance can be changed in
***Appearance*** > ***Customize*** > ***Frontpage Sections*** > ***Generic Sections #1-5***.
If your content doesn't belong to any of the listed sections, you can use these
for display.
