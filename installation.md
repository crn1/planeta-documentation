## Installing Plugins

This theme has two required plugins, which are called **Planeta Core** and
**Kirki Customizer Framework**. They contain all necessary functionality for
the theme to run properly. We recommend installing all required and recommended
plugins.

When you install Planeta Theme, at top of the admin dashboard you will be
prompted to install additional plugins for the theme.

1. Click on **Begin installing plugins**
2. Select all plugins from the list
3. In combobox **Bulk Actions** select **Install** and click **Apply**

All plugins will now be installed and activated automatically. After plugin
installation, you can proceed with importing demo content.

## Importing demo content

If you installed **One Click Demo Import** plugin, you can use it to easily
import all demo content that you saw on live-preview on ThemeForest.

1. In admin dashboard navigate to Appearance -> Import Demo Data
2. Select one demo from the list at bottom of the page and click **Import**.

> Note that depending on your hosting performance importing demo content can
take some time, up to one hour, so please be patient.

When the process successfully finishes, you can edit demo content to suit your
needs.

## Updating Planeta

For the best user experience and security reasons, we recommend you
update the theme as soon as the update is available.

> Make sure you do the backup all your content before updating the theme to
prevent any possible inconveniences. We are not responsible for any loss on
